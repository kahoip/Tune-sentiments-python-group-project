 ugh, school flunky, pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself, but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek fuck you i'm drunk, so, satan, take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz, still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have, then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then! but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then? don't mistake him for satan; it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard — be a king? think not why be a king when you can be a god?|Hip Hop/Rap|Eminem|426|The Marshall Mathers LP 2|17198172
